        <p>My wife always mocks me for everything I cook in the kitchen.She claims she is the better cook, but this recipe starts to turn the tables! Big shoutout to the brown eyed baker Michele for making this recipe a staple in my house!</p>
        <p>In addition to this recipe, I am planning on making an entire portfolio of amazing recipes for all my followers to try out! This is funny since I have no followers, and never intend on really speaking to an audience directly with this recipe portfolio! Who knows, maybe my lovely wife will see it and laugh someday... or maybe not</p>
