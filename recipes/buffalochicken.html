        <h2>Big time sandwich I have been making since I was 20 years old. That's over a decade. Damn, I am getting old.</h2>      
        <p>My wife defintely makes fun of me for this one too. I haven't made it in a while though because its unhealthy.Super tasty, but can't eat this stuff on a caloric restriction, that's for sure.</p>
        <p>Defintely the tastiest buffalo chicken sandwich known to man. I can't speak highly enough of this meal. Shoutout to Steak Escape for showing me the ropes on this one, and for not getting too mad when I didn't show up for work every now and again...</p>
